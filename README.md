**This is a simple math game I made using Python.**

## **What it does**:

- It asks how many numbers you want in the math problem (at least 2).
- It picks a random math operator: +, -, or *.
- It makes a math problem using random numbers (2 through 9).
- You type the answer to the problem.
- If you're right, it says "Good Boy!"
- If you're wrong, it says "Bad Boy!" and shows the correct answer.

## What I used in the code:

- Python
- The Random module
- Loops and if statements
- Inputs and outputs

## How to play

1. Run the Python file.
2. Type how many numbers you want in the problem.
3. Solve the problem it gives you.
4. Try again if you're wrong!

## Example output

```
How many numbers would you like in the equation? (minimum 2) 3  
What is 4 + 7 + 2?  
13  
Good Boy!
```

This is also the code I used for my AP Computer Science Principles exam, so it meets all those requirements.
