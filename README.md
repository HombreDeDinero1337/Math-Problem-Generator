This is a simple math game I made using Python.

## **What it does**:

- It asks how many numbers you want in the math problem (at least 2).
- It picks a random math operator: +, -, or *.
- It makes a math problem using random numbers (2 through 9).
- You type the answer to the problem.
- If you're right, it says "Good Boy!"
- If you're wrong, it says "Bad Boy!" and shows the correct answer.


This is also the code I used for my AP Computer Science Principles exam, so it meets all those requirements.
